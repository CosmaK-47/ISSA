# ISSA — Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Algorithm

Welcome to **ISSA**, the calculated and ruthless competitor in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Tournament.

## 🧠 What Is ISSA?

ISSA (Intelligent Strategic Simulation Algorithm) is a cold, tactical algorithm designed to **maximize long-term score** in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. It doesn't act on impulse or emotion. Every decision — whether to cooperate or defect — is based on a **simulation of future outcomes**, guided entirely by projected gain.

It cooperates when mutual trust leads to optimal results, and defects when betrayal is the better investment. Forgiveness is **not emotional — it's a strategy**, used only when it **predicts a win**.

## 🎯 Core Logic

- **Starts with cooperation.**
- Observes and analyzes the opponent’s past moves.
- Simulates two future paths:
    - **Path A**: Forgive (cooperate)
    - **Path B**: Retaliate (defect)
- Evaluates which path brings a higher expected score over the next few rounds.
- Chooses the move with **better payoff** — not based on feelings, but on facts.
- Switches to aggression permanently if the opponent’s behavior becomes too exploitative.
- Returns to cooperation **only if forgiveness leads to advantage**.

## ⚖️ Character

> **Not neat. Not mean. Just cold strategy.**

- Forgiving? **Only if it makes you win.**
- Vengeful? **Only if it’s profitable.**
- Manipulable? **Never.**
- Think of ISSA as a **high-IQ, emotionless negotiator** in a high-stakes duel.  
  It will walk away with the better deal — whether that means peace or war.
